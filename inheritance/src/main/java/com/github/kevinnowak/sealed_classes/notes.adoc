= Sealed Classes

* Introduced with Java 17
* Lets you control which classes can extend your class
* You basically define a restricted list of allowed subclasses
* Interfaces and abstract classes can also be declared with `sealed`
* A sealed class can be declared without a `permits` clause, but then all of its direct subclasses must be declared in the same file
* Benefits:
    ** Better control of subtypes
    ** Exhaustive pattern matching due to compile-time checking -> no `default` needed in `switch` expressions
    ** Allows accurate modeling of domain constraints
* Rules:
    ** Permitted subclasses of a sealed class must be accessible
    ** Subclasses must be `final`, `sealed` or `non-sealed`
    ** `final` = no further extension
    ** `sealed` = continues the restriction
    ** `non-sealed` = opens it back up for anyone to extend
