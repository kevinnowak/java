= Streams

* Streams represent a batch of objects (or base type values) that you encounter either serially or in parallel
* Streams can be built out of collections, but they are not collections themselves as they don't store data -> it's rather like a processing pipeline
* Streams are single use -> after a terminal operation they are closed
* Stream operations can be categorized into
** Intermediate operations
** Terminal operations
