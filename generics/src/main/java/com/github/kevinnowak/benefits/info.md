### Benefits of using generics

* Makes our code more scalable
* Avoid "incompatible type" errors when retrieving data from raw types
* Avoid a potential runtime ``ClassCastException`` error when explicitly typecasting
* Give us compile-time type checking, which helps detect bugs before our code runs
* Help when the JVM applies type erasure
