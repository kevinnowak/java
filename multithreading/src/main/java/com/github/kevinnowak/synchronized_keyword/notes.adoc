* Primary tool for preventing race conditions
* Race conditions happen when two threads try to change the same data at the same time
* Every object has an internal "intrinsic lock" (so-called monitor)
* Every class has a lock too (`ClassName.class`)
* When a thread enters a synchronized block, it "takes the key" to that lock
* Any other thread trying to enter must wait until the first thread drops the key
* Locking on `this` can be risky if external code also synchronizes on your object -> better use `private final Object lock = new Object();`
* `synchronized` static methods are one lock for all instances -> blocks across the entire JVM for that class
* `synchronized` instance methods lock `this` while `synchronized` static methods lock `ClassName.class` -> different locks -> no blocking of each other -> can run at the same time
* Main use cases of the `synchronized` keyword
    1. Synchronized Instance Methods
    2. Synchronized Blocks
    3. Static Synchronized Methods
